# A stupid simple swallower ðŸ˜‰.
### (Based on Process hierarchy)

Super easy to config. Uses `xdoool` WM/DE independent.


## Features
* Based on process hierarchy (don't care about window focus).
* cli like options. (super easy to use within scripts).
* Window Managers and Desktop Environment Independent.

```shell
pidswallow (pid swallow WM/DE independent)
Hides terminal window automatically, so that you don't have to

pidswallow [OPTION ...]

OPTIONS:
        -h  --help              Show this message
        -s  --swallow <CWID>    Hides parent window of the given child window id.
        -v  --vomit <CWID>      Unhides parent window of the given child window id.
        -t  --toggle <CWID>     toggle between swallow and vomit. (default)
        -g  --glue              treat if parent and child window are same. (recommended)
        -l  --loop              listen and hide / unhide window on launch / remove.
        -V  --verbose           Shows useful information.

```
* Just pass in the window id of the swallower.
* Work on a toggle mode. (swallow if not swallowed else vomit).
* Super fast. (Really!) (0.02s) (faster than before).

```
pidswallow '0x04800003'  0.02s user 0.04s system 107% cpu 0.058 total (swallow)
pidswallow '0x04800003'  0.01s user 0.01s system 71% cpu 0.032 total (vomit)
```

## Demo

[![Demo](https://yt-embed.herokuapp.com/embed?v=R6A_JHJ7ob8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6A_JHJ7ob8 "Demo for pidswallow.")


## How it works

```shell
takes wid as as arg --> gets process tree --> check blacklist --> hide parent.
```
## Dependencies
1) xdotool (Needed for pid -> window-id conversion).
2) xprop (Needed for window-id -> pid conversion).
3) windows needed to have `_NET_WM_PID`.

## Installation
1) Add `pidswallow` to your path.
2) Launch when WM/DE starts (Example: .xinitrc, i3-config, bspwrc)

```bash
pgrep -fl 'pidswallow -gl' || pidswallow -gl
```
3) Restart wm.

## Additional Configuration
The following environment variables can be exported to change the behavior of pidswallow.
They are evaluated through shell (sub shell), so most expressions should work. The special variables `{%pwid}` and `{%cwid}` hold the parent and child window IDs, respectively.

* `PIDSWALLOW_SWALLOW_COMMAND`: used to swallow (hide) windows. Default: `xdotool windowunmap --sync {%pwid}`
* `PIDSWALLOW_VOMIT_COMMAND`: used to vomit (unhide) windows. Default: `xdotool windowmap --sync {%pwid}`
* `PIDSWALLOW_PREGLUE_HOOK`: executed before gluing (resizing) new child window. Only applies when `--glue` is used. Default: empty

## Tested on
*(If you did please let me know, If it dosent work create a issue).*

* bspwm
* i3
* gnome
* openbox
* plasma (kde-plasma)

## Blacklisting
If you want to blacklist some program you need to black list their process name. (obtained from top/ps).
To the `blacklist` variable [space separated].

* no need to blacklist xev (xev will not be swallowed because it lacks `_NET_WM_PID`)

## Adding Terminals
* you can change the `swallowable` var to add term. (by default $TERMINAL is added).

## Knows Issues
* `sxiv` doesn't support this (as of now). https://github.com/muennich/sxiv/issues/398
    - Solution: https://github.com/elkowar/sxiv/tree/set_net_wm_pid (use this).

## Tricks
### Manual swallow (toggle)

1) Add `pidswallow` to your path.
2) run this and click on the child window (not the term) to swallow.
```
 xwininfo | awk '/Window id:/{print $4}' | tr '[a-f]' '[A-F]' | pidswallow -t
```
3) or pass the window-id via keyboard shortcut. (Eg: sxhkd toggle).

```
super + v
    pidswallow -t "0x$(echo "ibase=10;obase=16; $(xdotool getwindowfocus)" | bc)"
```

### Launch a program from term wihout being swallowed.
```
setsid -f <command>  # this will not swallow the terminal.
```

## WM specific recommendations
### bspwm
Add each set of lines to your `bspwmrc`, right before running pidswallow.
* Let bspwm handle window hiding.

```bash
export PIDSWALLOW_SWALLOW_COMMAND='bspc node {%pwid} --flag hidden=on'
export PIDSWALLOW_VOMIT_COMMAND='bspc node {%pwid} --flag hidden=off -f'
```
This way bspwm will remember window positions and won't lose track of swallowed windows.

* Follow `floating` state of parent (when using `--glue`).

```bash
# not working
export PIDSWALLOW_PREGLUE_HOOK='bspc query -N -n {%pwid}.floating >/dev/null && bspc node {%cwid} --state floating'
```
Check if parent window state is `floating` and apply the same to the child if that's the case.
This example should work in most cases, but feel free to add more complex hooks to your setup. (e.g. to mimic more properties of the parent).
